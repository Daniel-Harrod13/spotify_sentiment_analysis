# Sentiment Analysis with Spotify Data

This repository contains code and resources for performing sentiment analysis on Spotify data. 

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of text data. In this project, we aim to analyze the sentiment of song lyrics from Spotify's vast music library. By understanding the sentiment of songs, we can gain insights into the emotional impact of music on listeners.
 


## Results

This bar chart compares average sentiment scores (on the y-axis) against star ratings (on the x-axis, from 1 to 5). You can see that:

1-star ratings have a slightly negative average sentiment (around 
−
0.03
−0.03).
2-star ratings move into the positive range (about 
0.04
0.04).
3-star ratings have a moderate positive sentiment (~
0.09
0.09).
4-star ratings show even more positivity (~
0.19
0.19).
5-star ratings are the most positive (~
0.34
0.34).
Overall, the figure indicates that as the star rating increases, so does the average sentiment score. In other words, users who leave higher ratings also tend to use more positive language, while the 1-star reviews are slightly negative on average.
